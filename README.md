# Project Introduction to Machine Learning
These projects were made to complete the “Introduction to Machine Learning” course at my fourth semester of Informatics Engineering Study at Brawijaya University.  

In the first project, I used Condensed Nearest Neighbors (CNN) algorithm. CNN is one of the modified K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm that designed to reduce the data set for k-NN classification.

In the second project, I compared numeric data classification using Condensed Nearest Neighbors and Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm by the number of recall, preposition, accuration and f-1 score of the results from each classification algorithms.
